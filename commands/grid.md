# Grid of points

To make a grid of points, use a list comprehension. For example:

    [(x,y) for x=[0...3], y=[0...7]]

You may omit the outer square brackets. For more, see the [Lists help article](https://help.desmos.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407889068557-Lists), and scroll down to the section labeled "List Comprehension".
