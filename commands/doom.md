# Are we DOOM yet? (status: almost)

We've heard it all. "Someone PLEASE make DOOM in Desmos!" There's also the oft-repeated claim that "Desmos is Turing complete," so it *must* be possible, right?

So why does it feel like nobody has created a truly, visually faithful Doom port in Desmos yet?

Truth is, although there have been numerous Doom-inspired ports in Desmos:

- **[vaultthestars's version](https://www.reddit.com/r/desmos/comments/kt2vrj/finally_doom_fps_3d/)**: The first of the Desmos Doom ports, using now outdated simulator tech.
- **[Oman395's version](https://www.reddit.com/r/desmos/comments/18yjmfm/i_got_bored_in_class_like_45hr_later_heres_a/)** and **[gord1402's version](https://www.reddit.com/r/desmos/comments/1m8y4qa/doom_renderer_in_2d_graph/)**: More recent ports that use modern features.

**The main challenge lies in performance constraints**.

Most existing versions prioritize performance over graphics quality, because rendering detailed, faithful graphics would overwhelm Desmos's capabilities. Achieving visuals identical to the original Doom *would* be possible in principle, but it would be **very** difficult to make the game playable in real-time.

## Dark Keep

One notable exception is **[RichardFingers's Dark Keep](https://www.reddit.com/r/desmos/comments/1kypz5c/dark_keep_a_firstperson_desmos_game_of/)** - arguably the **closest** we've gotten to Doom in Desmos. It features impressive textures, engaging gameplay, and most of all, **relatively good runtime performance**.

The key issue is that this wasn't intended to be a Doom port. Also, controls are still limited by the 3D calculator constraints (keyboard input would be a difficult challenge), and it still runs at low FPS on lower end computers despite many optimizations.

So, while a faithful and performant Doom port in Desmos remains an elusive goal for now, our progress seems promising. Maybe, with your help, we can one day achieve this goal.
